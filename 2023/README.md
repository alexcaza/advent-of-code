# advent-of-code-2023

Advent of code 2023 originally started off as me wanting to learn Haskell. I quickly realized that I can't even model the problem in my head in Haskell, yet.

So, instead, I decided to solve each day in Typescript first, and then I'll revisit them in Haskell later. This way I can easily think about solving the problem, and use a functional-style typescript as a springboard for a Haskell implementation.

I've been wanting to learn Haskell for _years_, but haven't had a good avenue to learn. Advent of Code seemed like a perfect opportunity, which is why I went for it.
